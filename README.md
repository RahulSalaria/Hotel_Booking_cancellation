# Hotel_Booking_cancellation
a hotel booking dataset to identify patterns behind cancellations and customer behavior. After cleaning the data and performing EDA, I engineered features and built a predictive model to estimate cancellation likelihood. The project showcases my skills in Python, data analysis, and model building, with actionable business insights.
