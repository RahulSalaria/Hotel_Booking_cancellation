# üè® Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed a real-world hotel booking dataset to uncover insights around customer behavior and predict booking cancellations.

## Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored seasonal trends, cancellation patterns, and customer demographics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features to enhance model performance.
- **Modeling:** Built and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest models.
- **Feature Importance:** Identified key factors influencing cancellations.
- **Business Conclusion:** Derived actionable recommendations for hotel management teams.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Data Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

## Results
- Achieved strong predictive performance using Random Forest.
- Found that lead time, special requests, previous cancellations, and deposit type are critical predictors of cancellations.

## Business Impact
Understanding the key drivers of cancellations allows hotel businesses to:
- Offer targeted incentives to risky bookings.
- Adjust overbooking strategies based on customer type and lead time.
- Improve retention by addressing the concerns highlighted by predictive features.
